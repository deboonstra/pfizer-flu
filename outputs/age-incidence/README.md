# age-incidence
This sub-directory contains two CSV files generated by `age_incidence.R` in `scripts`. The purpose of these files are to be a collection of estimated reduction in attributable risk for all age groups given a 20% and 60% reduction in influenza incidence during the peak month. These data will be used to estimate reduction of inpatient and outpatient costs for each disease identified as being clustered with influenza given the age group. Below is a description of the variables in the data.

## `age_incidence_pct20.csv`

contains 89 observations and 5 variables that are associated with reducing the peak incidence of influenza by 20%.

- `age_cohort`: `chr` Identifies the age group of interest; the age groups are identified by the following unique values:
  - "Age: <2",
  - "Age: 2-4",
  - "Age: 5-11",
  - "Age: 12-17",
  - "Age: 18-34",
  - "Age: 35-44",
  - "Age: 45-54",
  - "Age: 55-64", and
  - "Age: >64".
- `ccs_code`: `int` Clinical classifications software (CCS) code used to aggregate ICD codes.
- `disease`: `chr` Description of disease associated with the CCS code.
- `pct`: `num` Decimal number indicating the percentage amount the peak incidence influenza was reduced by.
- `relative_change`: `num` Decimal number indicating the percentage amount the peak incidence of the disease of interest was reduced by given the peak incidence of influenza was reduced by `pct` percentage.

## `age_incidence_pct60.csv`

contains 89 observations and 5 variables that are associated with reducing the peak incidence of influenza by 60%.

- `age_cohort`: `chr` Identifies the age group of interest; the age groups are identified by the following unique values:
  - "Age: <2",
  - "Age: 2-4",
  - "Age: 5-11",
  - "Age: 12-17",
  - "Age: 18-34",
  - "Age: 35-44",
  - "Age: 45-54",
  - "Age: 55-64", and
  - "Age: >64".
- `ccs_code`: `int` Clinical classifications software (CCS) code used to aggregate ICD codes.
- `disease`: `chr` Description of disease associated with the CCS code.
- `pct`: `num` Decimal number indicating the percentage amount the peak incidence influenza was reduced by.
- `relative_change`: `num` Decimal number indicating the percentage amount the peak incidence of the disease of interest was reduced by given the peak incidence of influenza was reduced by `pct` percentage.
